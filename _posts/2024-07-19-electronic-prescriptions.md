Okay, not my choice, but one that impacts me...

Why did the Australian government decide to implement electronic prescriptions by farming it out to third parties, who then send an SMS with a link to a QR code?

Surely a better solution would have been to leave it in the hands of Services Australia, who operate Medicare and who are used to dealing with stuff like medical data? And be able to link the prescription to the existing Medicare or Services Australia online services and apps, rather than rely on text messages, obscure short links and QR codes.
