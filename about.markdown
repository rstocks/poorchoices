Poor choices. We all make them.

I think it all came about from a thread on our BoysChat (tm).

Sean mentioned that he'd watched [Madame Web](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11057302) and that it sucked. Given that it wasn't long since he confessed to also liking [Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14998742) he was, naturally, ridiculed for his terrible taste. I said I was going to register SeansPoorDecisions.com.

Of course, not long after that bout of hilarity I was forced to admit my own (latest!) poor life choice. Rather than register a domain for each of us it seemed simpler to go generic.
